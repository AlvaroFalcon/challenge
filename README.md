# frontend-coding

First Task:

- in the "feed" page, show a centered column of posts (use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to get the data) which are simple boxes with the title and body properties returned
- for each post, fetch its relative comments and show the counter, or nothing if there are no comments
- when clicking on the comment counter, the comments appear below it

Second Task:

- create a "vault" page, showing a responsive grid of suqare pictures (use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to get the data) which are simple thumbnails
- when clicking on a thumbnail, the fullscreen image opens

Bonus points:

- Type the responses from the API calls
- create meaningful tags in the head of each page
- creative css styling is welcome
- add the favicon stealing it from fanvue.com
- a11y considerations
